# AI-Powered Crop Disease Detection

This module trains and serves a deep learning model for crop disease detection using drone images.

## 1. Data Preparation
- Organize your images in `data/images/train` and `data/images/val` directories, with one subfolder per class (e.g., `Healthy`, `Disease1`, ...).
- Label images using tools like LabelImg or VGG Image Annotator.

## 2. Training

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install tensorflow flask
```

Train the model:
```bash
python train.py
```

## 3. Serving the Model

Start the Flask API:
```bash
python app.py
```

## 4. API Usage

Send a POST request to `/predict` with an image file:

```bash
curl -X POST -F "file=@your_image.jpg" http://localhost:5000/predict
```

Response:
```json
{
  "class": "Healthy",
  "confidence": 0.98
}
```

## Notes
- Update `CLASS_NAMES` in `app.py` to match your dataset classes.
- The model uses EfficientNetB0 and Keras for transfer learning.
- For best results, use diverse, well-labeled drone images.
