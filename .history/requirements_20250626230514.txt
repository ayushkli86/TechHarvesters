# Basic requirements for a chat-enabled web project
# If using only HTML/JS/CSS, no Python dependencies are needed.
# If you want to add a backend (e.g., Flask + SocketIO for real-time chat), use the following:
Flask>=2.0
Flask-SocketIO>=5.0

# If you plan to use React for the frontend, dependencies are managed in package.json, not here.
